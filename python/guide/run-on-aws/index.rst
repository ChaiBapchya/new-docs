Run on AWS
==========

This tutorial will guide you through Amazon SageMaker: a service that allows you to be up and running with MXNet in 5 minutes and to do Machine Learning at large scale in the quickest and easiest way possible.
Deep Learning projects usually consist of a set of problem tasks: for instance you may have to create training datasets, train and evaulate your model, tune its hyperparameters and finally deploy the model to a production ready cluster. This workflow can be quite cumbersome and time consuming. For this reason AWS provides Amazon SageMaker a fully managed machine learning service that accelerates the overall Deep Learning workflow.

User who only need compute instances rather than a fully managed SageMaker should follow chapter `Run on an EC2 instance <https://github.com/NRauschmayr/gluon-crash-course/blob/run-on-aws-updated/use_ec2.md#run-on-an-ec2-instance`_. EC2 provides specialized Deep Learning images so developers can start training their models right away without the hassle of installing driver and software frameworks.
