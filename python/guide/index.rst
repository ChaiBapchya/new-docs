Next steps
----------

- To learn more about using MXNet to implement various deep learning algorithms
  from scratch, we recommend the `Dive into Deep Learning
  <https://diveintodeeplearning.org>`_ book.

- If you are interested in building your projects based on state-of-the-art deep
  learning algorithms and/or pre-trained models, please refer to the toolkits
  in the `MXNet ecosystem <../index.html#ecosystem>`_.

- Check out the `API Reference docs <../api/index.html>`_.
