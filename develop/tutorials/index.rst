        If you would like to learn deep learning algorithms, please refer to the following book. It explain every algorithm from the beggining, and implements them from scratch with MXNet.

In this unit, we will go thourgh how to use MXNet to implement various deep
learning algorithms.

Get Started
-----------


We recommend you to start with the following crash course
for Gluon, the imperative frontend of MXNet.
