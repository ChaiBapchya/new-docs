        To learn deep learning from scratch, you can refer to the
        **interactive** dive into deep learning book.

In this unit, we will go thourgh how to use MXNet to implement various deep
learning algorithms.

Getting Started
---------------

We recommend you to start with :doc:`crash-course/index`. Gluon is the
imperative frontend of MXNet. Once you've completed the course, you should be
able to understand how to use the major components of Gluon, and define and
train a basic neural network to classify images.
