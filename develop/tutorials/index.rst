        If you would like to learn deep learning algorithms, please refer to
        "dive into deep learning" book. It explain every algorithm from the
        beggining, and implements them from scratch with MXNet.

In this unit, we will go thourgh how to use MXNet to implement various deep
learning algorithms.

Getting Started
---------------

We recommend you to start with :doc:`crash-course/index`. Gluon is the
imperative frontend of MXNet. Once you've completed the course, you should be
able to understand how to use the major components of Gluon, and define and
train a basic neural network to classify images.
