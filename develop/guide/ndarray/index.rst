Introduction to MXNet's NDArray
===============================

This section of the MXNet guide will teach you how to use MXNet's `ndarray` to move data around.
`ndarray` is the format you use when feeding data into a network for training, or later when you use a model for inference.

If you're new to deep learning and have not used Numpy arrays before, start with the intro and go from there.
If you have used Numpy arrays before then you can start with the advanced overview.
